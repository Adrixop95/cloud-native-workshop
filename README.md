## Introduction

Welcome to the first Cloud Native Workshop labs!  
You will learn the basic docker commands, how to prepare, build and run your first container and how to use docker-compose to run a group of containers.

## Installation  

Depending on what system you use, the docker installation may be different, the easiest way is to always follow the instructions provided in the Docker documentation:
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
- [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
- GNU/Linux:
    - [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
    - [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
    - [Centos](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)
    - [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)

If you have a GNU/Linux system, you can also consider performing additional optional configuration thanks to which, among other things, you will be able to execute commands without the need to elevate privileges â–¶ [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

After installing and launching the Docker application, let's run our first command to check the Docker version:
```
$ docker --version
```

## Basic commands
